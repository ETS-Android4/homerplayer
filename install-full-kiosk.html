<h2>Simple vs Full kiosk mode</h2>

<p>
Both modes aim at confining the user to within the app to protect him or
her from the complexity of the Android system and other apps.
</p>

<p>
The full kiosk mode is much more robust than
<a href="install-configure.html#enable-kiosk-mode">the simple one</a> (see the
video below) but it is also more difficult to set up, the exact steps are
described below.
</p>

    class="overlay" data-event-label="kiosk-modes"><i
      class="fa fa-play-circle fa-5x"></i></a>

</div>

<div class="additional-info info"><strong>Requirements:</strong>
The full kiosk mode requires Android version 5.0 or newer and it cannot be
enabled on a Kindle Fire. Older devices and Kindle Fire are limited to the
<a href="install-configure.html#enable-kiosk-mode">simple mode</a> only.
</div>

<h2>Installation steps</h2>

<p>
The precedure differs depending on the Android version that is running on your
tablet:

<ul>
  <li><a href="install-full-kiosk-adb.html">Android 5 and 6</a>,
  <li><a href="install-full-kiosk-qr.html">Android 7 and newer</a>.
</ul>
</p>
