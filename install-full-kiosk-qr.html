<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>
You will need:

<ol>
<li>A tablet or smartphone running Android 7+ equipped with a camera (there
are separate <a href="install-full-kiosk-adb.html">instructions for older
Android versions</a>).
<li>WiFi Internet connection (for the tablet).
</ol>

<h3>Important</h3>

<p>
The functionality needed for these installation steps, "QR provisioning", is
part of Android 7, however there are devices on which it doesn't work.
</p>
<p>
There is some limited information about availability of QR provisioning on
specific devices:

<ul>
  <li><a
  href="https://bayton.org/docs/enterprise-mobility/android/android-enterprise-device-support/">Jason
  Bayton has tested a number of devices</a>, look for your model and
  "<span style="color: #229922; font-weight: bold">âœ“</span> QR provisioning".
  <li>You can try googling the phrase (with the quotes):<br><em>
    &lt;your-tablet-model&gt; "QR provisioning"</em>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Please let me know what device you use if you succeed or fail so that I can
compile a list of supported devices.
</p>

<h2>1. Factory reset</h2>

<p>
The device needs to be cleared to its factory state so that Homer Player can
be installed as a priviliged app. This will allow it to activate the full kiosk
mode.
</p>

<p class="additional-info info">
<strong>Factory reset deletes all contacts, photos, music and other data from
  the device.</strong>
  <br>
  Make sure you copy all the important data to other devices before proceeding.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &rarr; <strong>Backup &amp;
    reset</strong>.
  <li>Tap <strong>Factory data reset</strong> to reset the device.
  <li>Reset will take a while. When it's finished <strong>do not start
  configuring the device</strong>, see the next step.
</ol>

<h2>2. Device setup with Homer Player</h2>

<p>
When the factory reset process finishes you are presented with the device
"Welcome" screen.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tap the "Welcome" screen 6 times (somewhere not on a button).
  <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to connect to the Internet and install
  additional components.
  <li>A camera app for scanning QR codes will show up.
  <li>Point the camera at the QR code below to scan it.<br>
  The code instructs the device to install Homer Player and make it a
  priviliged app so that it can activate the full kiosk mode.
  <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to finish installation of Homer Player.
</ol>

<img src="img/homer-player-device-owner-qrcode.png" class="img-responsive center-block" style="max-width: 12em">

<p class="additional-info info">
If tapping the "Welcome" screen doesn't have any effect it is likely your
device doesn't support "QR provisioning".<br>
Please e-mail me, I may be able to help.
</p>

<h2>3. Enable the full kiosk mode</h2>

<p>
Now you can enable and disable the full kiosk mode at will.

<ol>
<li>Start Homer Player.
<li>Tap 5 times on the screen to enter settings.
<li>Tap <strong>Prevent from exiting the application (kiosk mode)</strong>.
<li>Enable <strong>Full mode...</strong>
<li>Go back to leave the settings screen.
</ol>

<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/full-kiosk-mode.png">

Now it's impossible to leave the player application (you can revert this by
disabling the "Full mode..." option).
</p>
